"""Custom Prompt Tuning postprocessors.

There are 3 main postprocessors. The first is the `postprocesses_with_examples`
which wraps any other postprocessor function and save the results (as well as
other provided keys) into a dict instead of just returning the postprocessed
result.

There is also a postprocessor that removes the <extra_id_0> from the beginning
of an output. (This is used for the span checkpoints).

There are also postprocessors that translate between the output labels for the
qqp and mrpc tasks, used in testing the transferability of models.

  """Wrap a postprocessing function so that it returns a dict with extra info.

  Note:
    The decoded_model_output_field parameter allows for chaining multiple
    postprocessing functions while allowing access to intermediate values
    throughout the chain. For example, if you had a postprocessing function that
    mapped a set of words to a single one (allowing the model to output related
    label verbalizers and still be correct, e.g., "good", "great", and
    "positive" all mapping to positive). You could do this before the default
    postprocessors (that maps the label to an int) with `sequential` but then
    you would lose the actual string the model output as postprocessors only
    take strings as input.

    This arguments lets your postprocessors return a dict so that you can
    include this intermediate information (for example, the model's output was
    "good" and your postprocessors would output
    {"unified_prediction": "positive", "real_prediction": "good"}). Now you
    next postprocessor can be called with
    `decoder_model_output_field="unified_prediction"` allowing you to call the
    next postprocessor as if it was the first postprocessor, while still having
    access to values in the dict. For example, these original model outputs
    can be collected and create a distribution all the actual verbalizers the
    model uses for some class.

  Args:
    postprocess_func: The actual postprocessing function you are going to use.
    decoded_model_output: The output from the model.
    prediction_field: The dictionary key to save the postprocessed output to.
    prediction_text_field: The dictionary key to save the model output to.
    example_fields: Fields from the example to copy into the output.
    decoded_model_output_field: In the case where the decoded_model_output is a
      mapping (for example multiple of these functions are run in sequence),
      this field is key where the actual model prediction lives.
    **kwargs: Extra arguments. One should be `example` which has the unprocessed
      batch that has things like the raw text in it.

  Returns:
    A mapping that includes the postprocessed prediction, the raw prediction
    text, and any extra fields from the example you want.
