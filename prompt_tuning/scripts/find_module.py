r"""Find where a module is installed.

This tool is useful for finding where a package like T5X is installed so that
we can easily use the gin configs that are bundled with it.

Example usage:

python -m t5x.train \
  --gin_search_paths=`python -m prompt_tuning.scripts.find_module t5x` \
  --gin_file=t5x/configs/... \
  ...

def main(argv: Sequence[str]):
  if len(argv) != 2:
    raise app.UsageError("Missing module argument.")

  module = importlib.import_module(argv[1])
  print(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(module.__file__)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run(main)
